# FAIR Theory: Persuasive Arguments Theory

## Description

This is a FAIR implementation of Burnstein and Vinokur's "Persuasive Arguments Theory"
theory, a theory of group polarization through group discussions.
See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZWsHYC1vxffO_8S6M7soKv-wu5rG7UvxhIzmVQ_EPBo/edit?usp=sharing
for Construct Source Tables etc.

## Interoperability

The implementation of the theory can be used for simulating data and for testing the 
assumptions of the theory.
